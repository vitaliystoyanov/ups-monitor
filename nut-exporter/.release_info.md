## Breaking
- The following command line parameters are no longer available, but can stil be configured in the new `web.config.file` parameter ([with many others](https://github.com/prometheus/exporter-toolkit/blob/master/docs/web-configuration.md)):
  - `web.tls.cert_file`
  - `web.tls.key_file`
  - `web.auth.username`

## New
- TLS and web setup is now using the [Prometheus exporter-toolkit](https://github.com/prometheus/exporter-toolkit). This enables many new options and parameters to control the listening endpoint. Thanks, @SuperQ for the PR in #13!
- The exporter should now build for `riskv64` architectures now. Thanks for the suggestion in #31, @clausecker! Note: releases are not yet provided for this architecture

## Misc
- The sample dashboard now allows you to select the datasource. Thanks for #30, @paulfantom
